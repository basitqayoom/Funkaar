# Funkaar - Visual sound kit application
Project descriptionFunkaar is a portable animation and sound kit. Just touch with your finger to create a moving melody. The project uses sounds assigned to randomly sized circles to indicate when each alphabetic key is pressed.

This website was created to revive the form of traditional musical instruments of Kashmir. Taking full advantage of the latest technology, the instrument's melodic sound is integrated in a simple and user-friendly way. This website has been written with the possibility that its user base will vary from the elderly to the very young. It is therefore kept as simple as possible while making the most of the technology used to build the user interface. A fun and user-friendly experience are definitely exciting to you. We sought to mix old culture with something that delights young users so that young users can have an interest in old traditions.
